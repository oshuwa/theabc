  miss you calling me at work
  leaving stupid jokes on my phone

  like the one about the Arapaho, the Navajo,
  and the New York ho’

  miss you texting me cartoon stickers and
  voicemails in our native Diné

  your own private rebellion
  against the civilized world

  that thought they could erase us
  if we had no language to tell us who we are

  you taught me the prayers to Sun God
  saying the sun will always rise

  until it didn’t
  leaving a black hole

  deep in my bones
  the only way back

  a fury of erupting lava

  all that’s left is a last unsaid voicemail
  empty static

  and grief too great
  to fit into a rhyme scheme
