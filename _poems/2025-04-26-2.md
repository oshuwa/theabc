  Pain enters through an open window
  and you say it is the wind.

  It marrows into beams, gutters
  walls. Still you insist:

  It is only a passing storm.
  All while it seeps under your door—

  long having eluded the watchman,
  fallen asleep at his post—and floods

  the whole damn house. Come daybreak,
  you are a different kind of  hostage now,

  as it weeps into your bowl of porridge,
  casts itself  into the misshapen face

  gleaming back at you from a tarnished spoon.
  In time, you will make your bed

  with this new order. In time,
  you will simply make the bed and lie down.
