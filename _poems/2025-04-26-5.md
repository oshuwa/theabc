  Translated from the Arabic

  Not enough time to learn how to play an instrument that
  sounds like your steps climbing the stairs at home, or sing
  rhyming songs as you wash air from the fatigue of longing,
  not enough time to plant flowers the color of your clothes
  in the hanging pots of testament, and paint all these doors
  the untamed white of your scarf, nor even enough time
  to cut the grass in the hallways and make it seem like it just
  woke up in a hurry to see you, not enough time for us to
  explain to the windows the Reasons and Occasions as
  to why the Quran descended like rain one early morning,
  why the neighbors brought their chairs with them, and words
  of condolence in their pockets, which they scattered
  like salt on the thresholds, while at home
  there were neither birds, nor mothers.
