  This is why we came 

  To take as much from life as we can

  This is why we came 

  To live in every way

  Or, at least, in more than just one.

  This is why we came

  For joy, despite sadness. 

  For laughter, despite tears 

  This is why we came 

  For the profound, balanced by the mundane

  For the fool and the magician both.

  To speed through the heavens, taking only what we need

  And if we need, to take everything. 

  To touch and grow

  To fight, but never to lose 

  To laugh, even though we may cry too

  To love, even though we may lose to it.

  To dream dreams that may never come alive

  To wait till the end, to wish we could do it all again. 

  This is why we came 

  To love and then leave

  To hurt and then flee

  To break and to break

  Sometimes others 

  And sometimes ourselves

  To set fires

  And then dance in the flames.

  This is why we came

  To laugh with and laugh at.

  To laugh, so we do not cry.

  To touch and see and smell and feel

  To bask in the beauty of ourselves

  And the beauty of others

  For love, and for lust as well.

  To rise, and hope to never fall.

  To live, and hope to regret nothing at all.

  This is why we came.
