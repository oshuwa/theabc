  We land in the aisles of British fiction
  to soak in the air conditioning. Your fingers
  play the spines of the Brontës.
  I’ve seen you around.
  At the farmers market with a lick
  of bicycle grease on your calf,
  your canvas bag flush
  with beets. Or bundled, blocks ahead, urging
  your little dog through the snow.
  Today, you’ve scissored your clothes
  to the season: cutoff jeans
  and a sleeveless concert tee
  slit to the hem. The compass
  inked on your side points north.
  Nipples hard-bitten by the cold.
  You shelve Villette and music pours
  from the dark curls under your arm.
  Odd little bits of information,
  writes Lawrence, stir unfathomable passion.
  In three lifetimes, I could never read enough.
