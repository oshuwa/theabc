  “Head,” Alvin Marriott, 1955

  Why yu always ask stupid question, ee?
  The man call mango head because him head
  shape like mango. What do yu anyway?
  Yu come in with yu long face, gwyan
  with yu sufferation parade. Yu nuh see
  yu must either pick up yuself or put down
  what yu cayn carry? Gal, is time
  past time yu learn fi ban yu belly.

  Is only when yu young yu can afford
  fi believe the earth start spinning
  when you, missus, did step pon it. Cho. Things
  always been hard, mi love, and if you cyan
  squinch-up yuself, at least you can try fi hear
  what I telling yu: none of  we invent the story.
